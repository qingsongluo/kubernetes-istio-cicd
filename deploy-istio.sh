# To make the application available to the outside world a Gateway needs to be deployed.

# Now when you visit the Product Page the reviews will appear. As three versions have been defined within our Destination Rule
# By default, it will load balance across all available review services.

# Step 6 - Deploying Virtual Services / Deploy V1
# For the Bookinfo application, we have three different versions of a Reviews service available. The reviews service provides a short review, together with a star rating in the newer versions.
# By default, Istio and Kubernetes will load balance the requests across all the available services. We can use a Virtual Service to control our traffic and force it to only be processed by V1.
cat samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
# The file defines the Virtual Services for all the application. For every application, a host is defined (such as productpage), which is a DNS entry of how other applications will communicate with the service. Based on requests to this host, the route defines the destination and which Pods should handle the request.
# This is deployed via 
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
# When you visit the Product Page you will only see the reviews coming from our V1 service.

# List All Routes
# It's possible to get a list of all the rules applied using 
kubectl get virtualservices 
# and 
kubectl get virtualservices reviews -o yaml


# Step 7 - Updating Virtual Services
# As with all Kubernetes objects, Virtual Services can be updated which will change how our traffic is processed within the system.
# This Virtual Service sends all traffic to the V2 rating service, meaning our application would return the star rating
cat samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-v2.yaml
# This is deployed via 
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-v2.yaml
# When you visit the Product Page you will now see the results from V2.
# These Virtual Services become the heart of controlling and shaping the traffic within our system.


# Step 8 - Egress
# While the Bookinfo application doesn't need to call external applications, certain applications do.
# Istio is security focused, meaning applications cannot access external services by default. Instead, the egress (outbound) traffic needs to be configured.
# Deploy a simple Sleep pod which will attempt to access an external service.
kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml)

# Once started, attach to the container:
export SOURCE_POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=sleep -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})
kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep bash
# When you attempt to access an external service, it will return a 404.
curl http://httpbin.org/headers -i

# We need to configure our Egress. Exit the container as we need to deploy additional components.
# Egress is configured via a ServiceEntry. The ServiceEntry defines how the external can be reached.
kubectl apply -f /root/istio-1.0.0/serviceEntry.yaml
cat /root/istio-1.0.0/serviceEntry.yaml
# Repeat the process of attaching to the container:
kubectl exec -it $SOURCE_POD -c sleep bash
# When you attempt to access an external service, it will now return the expected response.
curl http://httpbin.org/headers -i
# Within the response, you can also identify all the additional metadata Istio includes to help build metrics, traceability and insights into the inner-workings of the network. These will be explored within the Observing Microservices with Istio course.

##################################################################################################################################

# Deploy V1
# The default deployment will load balance requests for the reviews across the different versions meaning on each request you may get a different result.
# As described in our traffic shaping scenario, Virtual Services are used to control the traffic flow within the system. Deploy the Virtual Services to force all traffic to V1 of our system.
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml

# Step 3 - Access V2 Internally
# The key to successful canary releases is being able to deploy components of the system into production, 
# test everything is successful for a small sample before rolling out to a larger user base. If everything is happy, 
# it can be deployed to 100% of the user-base.
# Virtual Services provide Layer 7 load balancing and traffic routing. Layer 7 means it's possible to route traffic based 
# on aspects of HTTP request, such as host headers, user agents or cookies.
# By having Layer 7 routing, we can provide a specific section of our users with a different response to the request of our user base.
# For example, if a user as a particular cookie, they could be sent to the V2 version. Using this routing is ideal for 
# allowing internal employees access before it goes live.
# The following Virtual Service implements this pattern. If the user is logged in as jason then they will be direct to V2. 
# As this VirtualService comes all the flow for the reviews host, at the end we indicate that everyone else who didn't match will go to the V1.
cat samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml

# When listing services you should only see the current version available.
kubectl get virtualservice
kubectl describe virtualservice reviews
# When you visit the Product Page you will only see the reviews coming from our V1 service. 
# If you log in at jason you will start to see the V2 service.

# Step 4 - 10% Public Traffic to V2
# Hopefully V2 is working successfully for Jason meaning it can be rolled out to production.
# Instead of sending 100% of traffic to V2, we want to slowly roll out the service. 
# To start with, only 10% of traffic should go to V2.
# With Virtual Services, this can be done by defining two route destinations. 
# Each of these destinations can have the desired weight.
cat samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-90-10.yaml
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-90-10.yaml
# When you visit the Product Page you will see mainly V1 responses, but every 1/10 should be V2. 
# The order isn't 100% even, but given a large enough distribution of traffic, the ratios will even out.


# Step 5 - 20%
# As confidence grows in v2, changing the Virtual Service weights will start sending more traffic to the latest version.

# Within the Katacoda Observing Microservices with Istio course, we explain how to use the Istio Dashboards, 
# Metrics and Tracing to identify when systems are working and the traffic distribution.

# Step 6 - Auto Scale
# During this canary deployment, our system is shifting load from our previous version to the desired version. As a result, the older version is receiving less traffic while our new version is increasing.
# Running both v1 and v2 at full capacity might not be possible given system resources available. Ideally, we'd like Kubernetes to scale up/down our Pods as the traffic changes.
# This is possible with Kubernetes by using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. Based on CPU usage of the pods we can change the number of Pods running automatically.
# The auto scale is defined based on the deployments running. This can be found with 
# The auto scale is defined based on the deployments running. This can be found with kubectl get deployment
# The deployments show that both v1 and v2 are running. We can tell Kubernetes to autoscale these components with the following commands:
kubectl autoscale deployment reviews-v1 --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
kubectl autoscale deployment reviews-v2 --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
# If the Pod CPU exceeds 50% then an additional Pod will be started, up to a maximum of 10.
#View all auto-scaling definitions with 
kubectl get hpa


# Step 7 - All Traffic to V2
# Once happy the Virtual Service can be updated to direct all the traffic to the v2 version.
cat samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-v2.yaml
# This is deployed with the command:
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-v2.yaml
# When you visit the Product Page you will see mainly V1 responses, but every 1/10 should be V2. The order isn't 100% even, but given a large enough distribution of traffic, the ratios will even out.
# The Grafana dashboards should also indicate that all traffic is going to Reviews Service v2.
